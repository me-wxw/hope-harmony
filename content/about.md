Hope & Harmony is the official newsletter of **Mary Elizabeth Baptist Church**. The vision of this newsletter is to provide engaging and informative content about our church. The goal is to create a sense of community and connection. Everything featured in our newsletter is in the context of Christian faith. Guest authors, interviews, scripture, and fun pieces will culminate in a publication that will reveal the hearts and minds of our congregation, inform our members and community, and serve as a blessing for someone.
