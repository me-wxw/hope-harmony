## Welcome

My dad has started leaving sweet potato recipes laying around the house, a telltale sign that Thanksgiving is near. Our family loves Thanksgiving. In the morning, the guys go rabbit hunting, more aptly called “woods walking,” and the ladies watch the parade and cook. In the afternoon, we sit down for a good meal and a good laugh about the cooking mishaps, like when the turkey caught on fire or the time my mom left the sugar out of the sweet potato pies. We ruminate over the blessings in our lives and recognize God deserves our praise for all things, great and small. I am especially thankful for the church family of MEBC. Thank you to each of you for creating a loving, caring, and comforting community of believers.

## Gratitude in God’s Words

### by Beth B

Gratitude is a feeling of thankfulness and appreciation for the good things in life, whether big or small.

> “And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them …”<br>[Luke 22:19 NIV](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/luk.22.19)

Thanksgiving creates abundance, and the miracle of multiplying happens when I give thanks. Try it when you’re struggling, having a hard day, or your heart is breaking. Make a list of everything you are thankful for from God. The list will be endless….and see what happens, your heart will turn to JOY!

“He gave thanks” reads “eucharisteo.” The root word of eucharisteo is charis, meaning “grace.” Charis, Grace. Eucharisteo, thanksgiving. Charia, JOY. I love that every Word from God has meaning.

There is not a day that goes by where I am not overfilled with gratitude to God for everything comes from Him who loves us.

> "Give Thanks to the Lord of lords. His faithful love endures forever. Give thanks to Him who alone does mighty miracles. His faithful love endures forever. Give thanks to Him who made the heavens so skillfully. His faithful love endures forever. Give thanks to Him who made the heavenly lights— His faithful love endures forever."<br>[Psalm 136:3-5](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.136.3-5)

## Helping Hands after Hurricane Helene

### with Brett F

![landscape](/images/wnc.jpg)

The mountain landscape was punctuated with downed trees, ruined homes, and debris. The devastation was still strikingly apparent. An area he had visited several times before was now the setting of catastrophe following Hurricane Helene. Brett F and a few crewmen from Union County Water traveled to the Asheville and Black Mountain area to assist in re-establishing sewer infrastructure. The crew cleaned up multiple sites for sewer line continuity, located manholes, and redug a manhole.

During excavations and clean-up, various debris was unearthed, but one thing stood out to him. It was a Bible. Caked with mud, he decided to pick it up and give it a closer look. When he opened it, the text was still clearly readable. It was a visual reminder that while the storm has destroyed so much, the Word of God still stands.

Weeks later using Facebook posts and messages, Brett was able to make contact with the owner of the Bible. They met in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Marion and he handed the Bible over to her. “I had cleaned up that Bible and had it for a week and a half, and I wasn’t even sure if the person who owned it was still alive,” Brett says as he recalls the meeting, “It was a relief to be able to meet her and give her that Bible after seeing so much devastation while we were working up there.”

The woman received the Bible when she was saved at the age of 7 as a gift from her grandmother. This woman’s excitement at receiving a treasured copy of God’s Word from the storm’s wreckage is a glimmer of hope amidst despair. God continues to work these small miracles. Anyone can be an instrument for an unexpected blessing; we just have to be willing.

We have had numerous other volunteers from our church to deliver supplies and assist in relief efforts. In October, MEBC collected a special offering to benefit the Baptists on Mission Hurricane Helene relief efforts. This mission group has set up large feeding and recovery operations in 14 areas of western North Carolina (WNC). For more information and volunteer and donation opportunities through this organization click here: [Baptists on Mission](https://baptistsonmission.org/). Our children’s ministry has elected to use shoebox donations and funds to send needed items and gifts to the children of WNC.

> “What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.“<br>[James 2:14-17](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jas.2.14-17)

Our willingness to help those in need stems from our faith. Our desire to be like Christ and the testimony of His sacrificial love fuels our good deeds. We are stirred to action, and our deeds testify to His name. Let us continue ministering mightily.

> "By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another."<br>[John 13:35](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/jhn.13.35)

## A Thankful Spirit is a Healthy Spirit

Thanksgiving is a wonderful time to express gratitude and reflect upon our blessings, but there are physical and spiritual benefits to having a thankful heart all year. When we take the time to appreciate our blessings and give thanks, there are positive changes in our lives. We can introduce more gratitude in our daily life instead of reserving it for one Thursday in November.

According to an article from the Mayo [Clinic Health System](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/can-expressing-gratitude-improve-health), a positive association between various areas of health and gratitude has been noted in several studies. These include improved sleep and mood, as well as decreased anxiety, depression, and morbidity.

An article from [UCLA Health](https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/health-benefits-gratitude) states grateful people are more satisfied with their lives, have better relationships, and have higher self-esteem. There are physiological impacts of gratitude including improved blood pressure, decreased risk of heart disease, and lower stress. Oxytocin, a hormone that builds positive connections between people and has an overall calming effect, is released when we express or feel gratitude.

From a spiritual aspect, thanksgiving is powerful in furthering the Kingdom of God and building a personal relationship with Christ.

> “I will praise the name of God with a song; I will magnify him with thanksgiving.”<br>[Psalm 69:30](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/psa.69.30)

Thanking God for the blessings he provides and for the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus magnifies Him in our lives and to those around us. We focus on the One from whom every good and perfect gift comes.

Furthermore, our faith is strengthened when we deeply reflect on God’s many blessings. I am reminded of Moses recounting to the Israelites all the times God provided for them and stayed with them while fleeing Egypt and living in exile (even though they were a stiff-necked people). They were about to enter the Promised Land and go toe-to-toe with the giants and warriors their scouts encountered years ago; a strengthening of faith is what they needed, and often it’s what we need.

The best way to develop a thankful spirit is to make a daily habit of gratitude. During an established prayer routine, thank God for his blessings and genuinely reflect on a certain one or two. Gratitude journals can be effective in re-routing a mental negativity slump. Exhaustive gratitude lists, focused gratitude lists, or an assortment of overlooked blessings can improve thankfulness.

Express your thanks to God, and the people around you. Write a note, send a text, make a phone call, however you want to do it let someone know you appreciate them! Make Thanksgiving more than just an annual tradition, make it a daily routine to better your health and spirit.

## Thankful For’s

![landscape](/images/fall-leaf.jpg)

Every night, my daughter and I say our “thankful for’s.” We list aloud all the things for which we thank God. The list always includes family and pets, sometimes teachers and friends, and some things give me an insight into what my toddler treasures. I am often surprised at her appreciation of small things, like leaves and hugs. In the spirit of Thanksgiving, our Sunday School classes tell us their “Thankful For’s”:
